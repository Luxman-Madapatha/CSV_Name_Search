## Functional Requirements


-	Console interface [dos]
-	Input file in csv format
-	Search function from csv dictionary
-	Analytics [refer below]
-	Output to a file in csv format
-	Dictionary should be editable

## Analytics

- First and Last Name matching based on the dictionary
- &quot;Match rating&quot; based on the number of characters matched as a percentage

## Input / Output Format

- One input corresponding to one output record
- Output file in CSV format
- **All characters in LOWERCASE**

## Non Functional Requirements

- Coding language - Python v3
- Compatible with both Windows 7 and 10 operating systems
- The tool should be portable
- Stand-alone product
- Easy to install

## Performance Requirements

- The software program-script can be used on a low configuration PC
- The software program-script can support bulk searches [10,0000+ records]

## Deliverables

- Python source-code with comments

## Sample Output 

_Tool that identifies email names from the list of person dictionary names from excel  (first names and last names)_

## File Description

- Database.csv -> input CSV file with names which are to be validated
- firstnames and lastnames.xlsx -> the fisrt name last name XLSX dictionary file used for name validation
- namesearch.py -> the Python script to run

## How To 
Place the above three files in a directory and run the namesearch.py
[ensure all required Python libraries are installed]

 - pandas [created, manipulate and save dataframes]
- re [string regular expressions]
- time [time operations]
- csv [comma separated file]
- sys [runtime environment]
- os [operating system interface]

The name dictionary can be updated with valid names as required. and the input names can be 
relaced with a new set


## Input DATABASE.CSV file is shown below [input names to be validated]
